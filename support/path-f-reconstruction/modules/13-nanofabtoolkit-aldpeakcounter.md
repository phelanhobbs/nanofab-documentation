# Path F Module 13 - Nanofabtoolkit Aldpeakcounter

This module is part of the Path F ultra-deep reconstruction manual. Its goal is to make the selected source area reproducible from documentation alone. Read the module conceptually first, then use the source reconstruction sections as the line-level reference.

## Files Covered

- `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/ALDPeakCounter.spec`
- `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/main.py`
- `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/requirements.txt`
- `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/assets/icon.py`
- `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/gui.py`
- `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/hook-matplotlib.py`
- `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/peakCount.py`

## Module Reconstruction Contract

A maintainer should be able to recreate these files by preserving public behavior, data contracts, route names, templates, command behavior, file paths, and operational boundaries. The code excerpts below are sanitized. Any redacted value must be supplied from secure local configuration, not recovered from this documentation.



# Source Reconstruction: NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/ALDPeakCounter.spec

- Repository: `NanofabToolkit`
- Relative path: `ALDPeakCounter/ALDPeakCounter.spec`
- Lines read: `51`
- Dirty in working tree at generation time: `no`
- Untracked at generation time: `no`
- Sanitized SHA-256 prefix: `489335d09e63f4c2`
- Code fence language: `text`

## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.

## Line-By-Line Reconstruction Notes

### Line 1

```text
import sys
```

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/main.py`, line 1 is classified as `import`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This dependency line names an external package, standard-library module, or local module. A rebuild must install or recreate that dependency before this file can run; edge cases are missing packages, version drift, import cycles, and local module name collisions. Neighbor context: previous kind is `none` and next kind is `import`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 6

```text
<blank line>
```

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/main.py`, line 6 is classified as `blank`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This blank line separates neighboring ideas. Keep an equivalent separation when recreating the file so imports, configuration, control flow, and output sections remain reviewable. Neighbor context: previous kind is `import` and next kind is `function`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 7

```text
def show_error_dialog(title, message):
```

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/main.py`, line 7 is classified as `function`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This function boundary is an interface.

## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.

```

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/requirements.txt`, line 1 is classified as `prose`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This documentation line is part of the original repo's operator or developer guidance. Preserve the claim only if it still matches source and live state; edge cases include stale paths, old deployment assumptions, and instructions that expose secrets. Neighbor context: previous kind is `none` and next kind is `prose`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

## Line-By-Line Reconstruction Notes

### Line 1

```text
from tkinter import PhotoImage
```

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/assets/icon.py`, line 1 is classified as `import`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This dependency line names an external package, standard-library module, or local module. A rebuild must install or recreate that dependency before this file can run; edge cases are missing packages, version drift, import cycles, and local module name collisions. Neighbor context: previous kind is `none` and next kind is `blank`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 2

```text
<blank line>
```

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/assets/icon.py`, line 2 is classified as `blank`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This blank line separates neighboring ideas. Keep an equivalent separation when recreating the file so imports, configuration, control flow, and output sections remain reviewable. Neighbor context: previous kind is `import` and next kind is `function`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/assets/icon.py`, line 10 is classified as `database`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This database line affects durable state. Preserve table names, column names, constraints, query parameters, transaction boundaries, commit timing, rollback behavior, and migration assumptions; edge cases are missing rows, duplicate rows, concurrent writes, schema drift, and failed commits. Neighbor context: previous kind is `generic` and next kind is `filesystem`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
21. **Disk Pressure**: When recreating `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/assets/icon.py`, test the `disk pressure` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
22. **Old Source Copy**: When recreating `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/assets/icon.py`, test the `old source copy` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
23. **Production Versus Development Configuration**: When recreating `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/assets/icon.py`, test the `production versus development configuration` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
24. **Redacted Secret Reconstruction**: When recreating `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/assets/icon.py`, test the `redacted secret reconstruction` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.

## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.

## Line-By-Line Reconstruction Notes

### Line 1

```text
import os
```

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/gui.py`, line 1 is classified as `import`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This dependency line names an external package, standard-library module, or local module. A rebuild must install or recreate that dependency before this file can run; edge cases are missing packages, version drift, import cycles, and local module name collisions. Neighbor context: previous kind is `none` and next kind is `import`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 2

```text
import tkinter as tk
```

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/gui.py`, line 2 is classified as `import`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This dependency line names an external package, standard-library module, or local module. A rebuild must install or recreate that dependency before this file can run; edge cases are missing packages, version drift, import cycles, and local module name collisions. Neighbor context: previous kind is `import` and next kind is `import`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 3

```text
from tkinter import filedialog, ttk, messagebox
```

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/gui.py`, line 3 is classified as `import`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This dependency line names an external package, standard-library module, or local module. A rebuild must install or recreate that dependency before this file can run; edge cases are missing packages, version drift, import cycles, and local module name collisions.

When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 4

```text
from matplotlib.figure import Figure
```

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/gui.py`, line 4 is classified as `import`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This dependency line names an external package, standard-library module, or local module. A rebuild must install or recreate that dependency before this file can run; edge cases are missing packages, version drift, import cycles, and local module name collisions. Neighbor context: previous kind is `import` and next kind is `import`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 5

```text
from matplotlib.backends.backend_tkagg import FigureCanvasTkAgg
```

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/gui.py`, line 5 is classified as `import`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This dependency line names an external package, standard-library module, or local module. A rebuild must install or recreate that dependency before this file can run; edge cases are missing packages, version drift, import cycles, and local module name collisions.

### Line 6

```text
import matplotlib.cm as cm  # For color maps
```

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/gui.py`, line 6 is classified as `import`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This dependency line names an external package, standard-library module, or local module.

### Line 7

```text
from numpy import array, zeros, where
```

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/gui.py`, line 7 is classified as `import`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This dependency line names an external package, standard-library module, or local module. A rebuild must install or recreate that dependency before this file can run; edge cases are missing packages, version drift, import cycles, and local module name collisions. Neighbor context: previous kind is `import` and next kind is `blank`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 8

```text
<blank line>
```

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/gui.py`, line 8 is classified as `blank`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This blank line separates neighboring ideas. Keep an equivalent separation when recreating the file so imports, configuration, control flow, and output sections remain reviewable. Neighbor context: previous kind is `import` and next kind is `comment`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 9

```text
# Import your peak counter module

## Edge-Case Matrix For This File

1. **Empty Input**: When recreating `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/gui.py`, test the `empty input` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
2. **Single Input**: When recreating `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/gui.py`, test the `single input` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
3. **Large Input**: When recreating `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/gui.py`, test the `large input` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system.

## Line-By-Line Reconstruction Notes

### Line 1

```text
from PyInstaller.utils.hooks import collect_submodules
```

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/hook-matplotlib.py`, line 1 is classified as `import`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This dependency line names an external package, standard-library module, or local module. A rebuild must install or recreate that dependency before this file can run; edge cases are missing packages, version drift, import cycles, and local module name collisions. Neighbor context: previous kind is `none` and next kind is `blank`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 2

```text
<blank line>
```

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/hook-matplotlib.py`, line 2 is classified as `blank`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This blank line separates neighboring ideas. Keep an equivalent separation when recreating the file so imports, configuration, control flow, and output sections remain reviewable. Neighbor context: previous kind is `import` and next kind is `comment`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 3

```text
# Only include necessary backends
```

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/hook-matplotlib.py`, line 3 is classified as `comment`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This comment or prose line records intent, operator guidance, or historical context. Recreate the underlying behavior from code evidence, but preserve any operational warning because comments here often explain safety boundaries. Neighbor context: previous kind is `blank` and next kind is `assignment`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 4

```text
hiddenimports = ['matplotlib.backends.backend_tkagg']
```

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/hook-matplotlib.py`, line 4 is classified as `assignment`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This assignment establishes configuration, state, a constant, or an intermediate value. Preserve when it is evaluated, whether it is mutable, whether it can be overridden, and whether it is safe to expose; edge cases include defaults that are fine locally but unsafe in production. Neighbor context: previous kind is `comment` and next kind is `blank`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 5

```text
<blank line>
```

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/hook-matplotlib.py`, line 5 is classified as `blank`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This blank line separates neighboring ideas. Keep an equivalent separation when recreating the file so imports, configuration, control flow, and output sections remain reviewable. Neighbor context: previous kind is `assignment` and next kind is `comment`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 6

```text
# Exclude unnecessary backends
```

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/hook-matplotlib.py`, line 6 is classified as `comment`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This comment or prose line records intent, operator guidance, or historical context. Recreate the underlying behavior from code evidence, but preserve any operational warning because comments here often explain safety boundaries. Neighbor context: previous kind is `blank` and next kind is `assignment`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 7

```text
excludedimports = ['matplotlib.backends.backend_qt5agg',
```

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/hook-matplotlib.py`, line 7 is classified as `assignment`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This assignment establishes configuration, state, a constant, or an intermediate value. Preserve when it is evaluated, whether it is mutable, whether it can be overridden, and whether it is safe to expose; edge cases include defaults that are fine locally but unsafe in production. Neighbor context: previous kind is `comment` and next kind is `generic`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 8

```text
                  'matplotlib.backends.backend_qt4agg',
```

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/hook-matplotlib.py`, line 8 is classified as `generic`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This line contributes to the file's behavior or documentation. Recreate it by preserving inputs, outputs, ordering, and side effects; edge cases are missing context, unexpected data, and differences between development and production. Neighbor context: previous kind is `assignment` and next kind is `generic`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 9

```text
                  'matplotlib.backends.backend_cairo',
```

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/hook-matplotlib.py`, line 9 is classified as `generic`.

### Line 10

```text
                  'matplotlib.backends.backend_gtk3cairo']
```

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ALDPeakCounter/src/hook-matplotlib.py`, line 10 is classified as `generic`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This line contributes to the file's behavior or documentation.

A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This assignment establishes configuration, state, a constant, or an intermediate value. Preserve when it is evaluated, whether it is mutable, whether it can be overridden, and whether it is safe to expose; edge cases include defaults that are fine locally but unsafe in production. Neighbor context: previous kind is `assignment` and next kind is `generic`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.
