# Path F Module 02 - Deployment Server Configuration

This module is part of the Path F ultra-deep reconstruction manual. Its goal is to make the selected source area reproducible from documentation alone. Read the module conceptually first, then use the source reconstruction sections as the line-level reference.

## Files Covered

- `UNanofabTools/.env.example`
- `UNanofabTools/config/config.py`
- `UNanofabTools/quick_setup.sh`
- `UNanofabTools/requirements.txt`
- `UNanofabTools/run.py`
- `UNanofabTools/setup.sh`

## Module Reconstruction Contract

A maintainer should be able to recreate these files by preserving public behavior, data contracts, route names, templates, command behavior, file paths, and operational boundaries. The code excerpts below are sanitized. Any redacted value must be supplied from secure local configuration, not recovered from this documentation.



# Source Reconstruction: UNanofabTools/.env.example

- Repository: `UNanofabTools`
- Relative path: `.env.example`
- Lines read: `40`
- Dirty in working tree at generation time: `no`
- Untracked at generation time: `no`
- Sanitized SHA-256 prefix: `5fc564069d36c6c1`
- Code fence language: `text`

## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.

## Line-By-Line Reconstruction Notes

### Line 1

```text
# Flask Configuration
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/.env.example`, line 1 is classified as `comment`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This comment or prose line records intent, operator guidance, or historical context. Recreate the underlying behavior from code evidence, but preserve any operational warning because comments here often explain safety boundaries. Neighbor context: previous kind is `none` and next kind is `generic`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 2

```text
FLASK_APP=run.py
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/.env.example`, line 2 is classified as `generic`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This line contributes to the file's behavior or documentation. Recreate it by preserving inputs, outputs, ordering, and side effects; edge cases are missing context, unexpected data, and differences between development and production. Neighbor context: previous kind is `comment` and next kind is `generic`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.

## Line-By-Line Reconstruction Notes

### Line 1

```text
"""
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/config/config.py`, line 1 is classified as `generic`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This line contributes to the file's behavior or documentation. Recreate it by preserving inputs, outputs, ordering, and side effects; edge cases are missing context, unexpected data, and differences between development and production. Neighbor context: previous kind is `none` and next kind is `generic`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 2

# Source Reconstruction: UNanofabTools/quick_setup.sh

- Repository: `UNanofabTools`
- Relative path: `quick_setup.sh`
- Lines read: `142`
- Dirty in working tree at generation time: `no`
- Untracked at generation time: `no`
- Sanitized SHA-256 prefix: `1a8b492b7583802f`

## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.

## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.

## Line-By-Line Reconstruction Notes

### Line 1

```text
"""
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/run.py`, line 1 is classified as `generic`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This line contributes to the file's behavior or documentation. Recreate it by preserving inputs, outputs, ordering, and side effects; edge cases are missing context, unexpected data, and differences between development and production. Neighbor context: previous kind is `none` and next kind is `generic`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 2

```text

Neighbor context: previous kind is `filesystem` and next kind is `blank`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 13

```text
<blank line>
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/run.py`, line 13 is classified as `blank`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes.

```text
if __name__ == '__main__':
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/run.py`, line 14 is classified as `branch`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This branch decides between pathways. Recreate the condition and both the taken and not-taken behavior; edge cases include falsy values, missing keys, unexpected types, stale state, and a condition that was assumed impossible but occurs in production. Neighbor context: previous kind is `blank` and next kind is `assignment`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.
