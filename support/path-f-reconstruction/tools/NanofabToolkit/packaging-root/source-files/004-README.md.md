## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.

## Sanitized Source Excerpt

```markdown
## NanofabToolKit

Below are some tools developed by Phe Hobbs for the University of Utah's Nanofab department.
Information about us can be found at nanofab.utah.edu


# ALDPeakCounter

The ALDpeakcounter takes a csv file from and graphs the file while also providing a numerical count of local maximums.
This graph is zoomable and allows for multiple charts in order for users to draw comparisons, which can performed using the x-axis translation tool.
Additionally, by adjusting the peak detection parameters, it is possible to make the counting more or less sensitive allowing for quick reads of the number of peaks in the provided csv.

# DentonDecoder

The Denton Decoder program loads in one or more .dat file from the Denton635 machine and converts it to a (much) more readable csv.
After conversion, it then allows a user to graph any of the columns produced.
As with the ALD peak counter, this program allows users to translate their graphs left and right for ease of comparisons.

# PreciousMetalReader

The Precious Metal Reader allows users to automatically and easily download the total usage for four precious metals.
This downloads the information from cores.utah.edu and automatically converts it to a csv split by users alongside their personal usage of the metals per tool.
These metals are Iridium, Gold, Platinum, and Palladium and the tools are the Denton16, Denton635, and TMV.
A module named "auth.py" with the authentication code must be provided.

```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:phelanhobbs/NanofabToolKit.git
   cd NanofabToolKit
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r /[toolname]/requirements.txt
   ```

3. (RetrieveMonthlyMetals only) Add the auth.py file to the program (you will need to ask for this)
    ```
    echo "HSCCode = '[code]'" > /RetrieveMonthlyMetals/src/auth.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```
   python /[toolname]/main.py
   ```

2. Working with the application:

# ALDPeakCounter

- Add data files using the file selection dialog
- Set peak detection parameters (height, prominence, distance, width)
- Process the files to detect peaks
- Apply offsets to adjust data as needed
- View results in both text format and interactive plots
- Reset offsets if necessary

# DentonDecoder

- Add data files using the file selection dialog
- Set graphing parameters (column to graph, log scale)
- Hit Generate Graph to generate the graphing
- Use the time alignment section to move data left and right
- Reset offsets if necessary

# PreciousMetalReader

- First authentication data must be added manually
- Download useage per month to month basis of 4 different precious metals
- Precious Metal usage is denoted by both user and tools
- Downloads information from the cores website without needing to sign in

# ParalyneReader

- Gathers log files from the server without needing to sing in
- allows users to disable smoothing or alter the algorithm being used
- allows users to denote when and how long it takes to pump down the paralyne machine
- has horizontal bar at y=15 as that is what is considered "pumped down"
- having multiple runs allows users to compare runs
