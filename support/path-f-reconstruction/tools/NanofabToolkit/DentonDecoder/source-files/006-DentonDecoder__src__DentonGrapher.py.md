## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.

### Line 1

```text
import argparse

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/DentonDecoder/src/DentonGrapher.py`, line 1 is classified as `import`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This dependency line names an external package, standard-library module, or local module. A rebuild must install or recreate that dependency before this file can run; edge cases are missing packages, version drift, import cycles, and local module name collisions. Neighbor context: previous kind is `none` and next kind is `import`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/DentonDecoder/src/DentonGrapher.py`, line 119 is classified as `comment`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This comment or prose line records intent, operator guidance, or historical context. Recreate the underlying behavior from code evidence, but preserve any operational warning because comments here often explain safety boundaries. Neighbor context: previous kind is `blank` and next kind is `branch`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

## Edge-Case Matrix For This File

1. **Empty Input**: When recreating `NanofabToolkit/DentonDecoder/src/DentonGrapher.py`, test the `empty input` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
2. **Single Input**: When recreating `NanofabToolkit/DentonDecoder/src/DentonGrapher.py`, test the `single input` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
3. **Large Input**: When recreating `NanofabToolkit/DentonDecoder/src/DentonGrapher.py`, test the `large input` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
4. **Duplicate Input**: When recreating `NanofabToolkit/DentonDecoder/src/DentonGrapher.py`, test the `duplicate input` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
5. **Malformed Input**: When recreating `NanofabToolkit/DentonDecoder/src/DentonGrapher.py`, test the `malformed input` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
6. **Missing File**: When recreating `NanofabToolkit/DentonDecoder/src/DentonGrapher.py`, test the `missing file` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
7. **Permission Denied**: When recreating `NanofabToolkit/DentonDecoder/src/DentonGrapher.py`, test the `permission denied` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
8. **Network Timeout**: When recreating `NanofabToolkit/DentonDecoder/src/DentonGrapher.py`, test the `network timeout` case explicitly.
