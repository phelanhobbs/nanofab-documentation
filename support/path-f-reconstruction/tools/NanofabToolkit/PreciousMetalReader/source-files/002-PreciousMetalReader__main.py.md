## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.

## Line-By-Line Reconstruction Notes

### Line 1

```text
import tkinter as tk
```

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/PreciousMetalReader/main.py`, line 1 is classified as `import`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This dependency line names an external package, standard-library module, or local module. A rebuild must install or recreate that dependency before this file can run; edge cases are missing packages, version drift, import cycles, and local module name collisions. Neighbor context: previous kind is `none` and next kind is `import`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 2

```text
import sys
