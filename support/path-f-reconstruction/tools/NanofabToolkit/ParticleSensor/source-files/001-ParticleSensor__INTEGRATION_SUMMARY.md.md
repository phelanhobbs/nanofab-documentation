## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ParticleSensor/INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md`, line 1 is classified as `comment`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This comment or prose line records intent, operator guidance, or historical context. Recreate the underlying behavior from code evidence, but preserve any operational warning because comments here often explain safety boundaries. Neighbor context: previous kind is `none` and next kind is `blank`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This documentation line is part of the original repo's operator or developer guidance. Preserve the claim only if it still matches source and live state; edge cases include stale paths, old deployment assumptions, and instructions that expose secrets. Neighbor context: previous kind is `blank` and next kind is `prose`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.
