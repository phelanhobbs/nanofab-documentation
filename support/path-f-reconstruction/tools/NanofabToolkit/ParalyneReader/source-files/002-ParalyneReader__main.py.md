## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.

## Python Structure Summary

ParalyneReader Main Application

A GUI application for downloading, processing, and visualizing Paralyne analog data files.
This application connects to the nanofab history API to fetch and analyze Paralyne process data.

Features:
- Download files from the Paralyne analog data API
- Load and parse CSV data files
- Apply various smoothing and normalization techniques
- Generate interactive plots with matplotlib
- Time alignment and data comparison capabilities

## Line-By-Line Reconstruction Notes

### Line 1

```text
#!/usr/bin/env python3
```

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ParalyneReader/main.py`, line 1 is classified as `comment`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This comment or prose line records intent, operator guidance, or historical context. Recreate the underlying behavior from code evidence, but preserve any operational warning because comments here often explain safety boundaries. Neighbor context: previous kind is `none` and next kind is `generic`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 2

```text

```

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ParalyneReader/main.py`, line 2 is classified as `generic`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This line contributes to the file's behavior or documentation. Recreate it by preserving inputs, outputs, ordering, and side effects; edge cases are missing context, unexpected data, and differences between development and production. Neighbor context: previous kind is `comment` and next kind is `filesystem`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 3

```text

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ParalyneReader/main.py`, line 36 is classified as `assignment`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This assignment establishes configuration, state, a constant, or an intermediate value. Preserve when it is evaluated, whether it is mutable, whether it can be overridden, and whether it is safe to expose; edge cases include defaults that are fine locally but unsafe in production. Neighbor context: previous kind is `generic` and next kind is `assignment`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ParalyneReader/main.py`, line 83 is classified as `blank`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This blank line separates neighboring ideas. Keep an equivalent separation when recreating the file so imports, configuration, control flow, and output sections remain reviewable. Neighbor context: previous kind is `filesystem` and next kind is `comment`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

Reconstruction rule: in `NanofabToolkit/ParalyneReader/main.py`, line 130 is classified as `function`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This function boundary is an interface. Preserve its name-level responsibility, parameters, return value, exceptions, side effects, and logging behavior; edge cases include None inputs, empty collections, filesystem absence, failed network calls, and repeated invocation. Neighbor context: previous kind is `blank` and next kind is `generic`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
22. **Old Source Copy**: When recreating `NanofabToolkit/ParalyneReader/main.py`, test the `old source copy` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
23. **Production Versus Development Configuration**: When recreating `NanofabToolkit/ParalyneReader/main.py`, test the `production versus development configuration` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
24. **Redacted Secret Reconstruction**: When recreating `NanofabToolkit/ParalyneReader/main.py`, test the `redacted secret reconstruction` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
