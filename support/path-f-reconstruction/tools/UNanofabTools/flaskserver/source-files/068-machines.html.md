## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.

## Line-By-Line Reconstruction Notes

### Line 1

```text
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/machines.html`, line 1 is classified as `html`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This HTML structure controls what the user sees. Preserve hierarchy, semantic meaning, important classes and ids, and template blocks; edge cases include long text, missing data, mobile layout, and hidden dependencies used by JavaScript. Neighbor context: previous kind is `none` and next kind is `comment`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
17. **Wrong Working Directory**: When recreating `UNanofabTools/machines.html`, test the `wrong working directory` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
18. **Wrong User Account**: When recreating `UNanofabTools/machines.html`, test the `wrong user account` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.

The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
20. **Backup Restore**: When recreating `UNanofabTools/machines.html`, test the `backup restore` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system.
