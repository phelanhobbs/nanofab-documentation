## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.

## Edge-Case Matrix For This File

1. **Empty Input**: When recreating `UNanofabTools/migrations/script.py.mako`, test the `empty input` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
