## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.

### Line 39

```text

```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/ALD_chart.html`, line 39 is classified as `blank`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This blank line separates neighboring ideas. Keep an equivalent separation when recreating the file so imports, configuration, control flow, and output sections remain reviewable.
