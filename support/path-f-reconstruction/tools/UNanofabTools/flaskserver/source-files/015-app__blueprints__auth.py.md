## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.

## Line-By-Line Reconstruction Notes

### Line 1

```text
"""
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/app/blueprints/auth.py`, line 1 is classified as `generic`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This line contributes to the file's behavior or documentation. Recreate it by preserving inputs, outputs, ordering, and side effects; edge cases are missing context, unexpected data, and differences between development and production. Neighbor context: previous kind is `none` and next kind is `generic`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 2

### Line 9

```text
<blank line>
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/app/blueprints/auth.py`, line 9 is classified as `blank`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This blank line separates neighboring ideas. Keep an equivalent separation when recreating the file so imports, configuration, control flow, and output sections remain reviewable.

A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This assignment establishes configuration, state, a constant, or an intermediate value. Preserve when it is evaluated, whether it is mutable, whether it can be overridden, and whether it is safe to expose; edge cases include defaults that are fine locally but unsafe in production.

Neighbor context: previous kind is `blank` and next kind is `route`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 13

```text

```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/app/blueprints/auth.py`, line 13 is classified as `route`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This route decorator is an HTTP contract. Preserve the URL rule, allowed methods, authentication posture, request payload shape, response type, redirects, template names, and side effects; edge cases include wrong method, missing form fields, unauthenticated callers, stale sessions, and malformed device payloads. Neighbor context: previous kind is `blank` and next kind is `function`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 14

## Edge-Case Matrix For This File

1. **Empty Input**: When recreating `UNanofabTools/app/blueprints/auth.py`, test the `empty input` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
2. **Single Input**: When recreating `UNanofabTools/app/blueprints/auth.py`, test the `single input` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
3. **Large Input**: When recreating `UNanofabTools/app/blueprints/auth.py`, test the `large input` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
