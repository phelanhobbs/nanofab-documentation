## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.

## Python Structure Summary

- Imports: `from datetime import datetime`, `from flask_login import UserMixin`, `from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy`, `from .particle_sensor import ParticleSensorData`
- Classes: `User`, `Session`, `Task`, `TaskAssignee`, `TaskFile`

## Edge-Case Matrix For This File

1. **Empty Input**: When recreating `UNanofabTools/app/models/__init__.py`, test the `empty input` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
2. **Single Input**: When recreating `UNanofabTools/app/models/__init__.py`, test the `single input` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
3. **Large Input**: When recreating `UNanofabTools/app/models/__init__.py`, test the `large input` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
4. **Duplicate Input**: When recreating `UNanofabTools/app/models/__init__.py`, test the `duplicate input` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
5. **Malformed Input**: When recreating `UNanofabTools/app/models/__init__.py`, test the `malformed input` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
6. **Missing File**: When recreating `UNanofabTools/app/models/__init__.py`, test the `missing file` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
7. **Permission Denied**: When recreating `UNanofabTools/app/models/__init__.py`, test the `permission denied` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
8. **Network Timeout**: When recreating `UNanofabTools/app/models/__init__.py`, test the `network timeout` case explicitly.
