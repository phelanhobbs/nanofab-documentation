## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.

## Line-By-Line Reconstruction Notes

### Line 1

```text
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/signup.html`, line 1 is classified as `html`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This HTML structure controls what the user sees. Preserve hierarchy, semantic meaning, important classes and ids, and template blocks; edge cases include long text, missing data, mobile layout, and hidden dependencies used by JavaScript. Neighbor context: previous kind is `none` and next kind is `comment`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 2

```text
<!-- HTML for the sign up page --> >
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/signup.html`, line 2 is classified as `comment`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This comment or prose line records intent, operator guidance, or historical context. Recreate the underlying behavior from code evidence, but preserve any operational warning because comments here often explain safety boundaries. Neighbor context: previous kind is `html` and next kind is `html`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.
