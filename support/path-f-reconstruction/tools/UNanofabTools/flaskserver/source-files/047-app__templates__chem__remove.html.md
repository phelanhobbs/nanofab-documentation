## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.

## Line-By-Line Reconstruction Notes

### Line 1

```text
{% extends "chem/base.html" %}
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/app/templates/chem/remove.html`, line 1 is classified as `template`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This template expression bridges server data into HTML. Preserve variable names, filters, loops, and conditional rendering; edge cases include missing context keys, empty lists, unsafe HTML, and values that need escaping. Neighbor context: previous kind is `none` and next kind is `template`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 2

```text

Neighbor context: previous kind is `template` and next kind is `blank`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 4

```text
<blank line>
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/app/templates/chem/remove.html`, line 4 is classified as `blank`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This blank line separates neighboring ideas. Keep an equivalent separation when recreating the file so imports, configuration, control flow, and output sections remain reviewable.

## Edge-Case Matrix For This File

1. **Empty Input**: When recreating `UNanofabTools/app/templates/chem/remove.html`, test the `empty input` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
2. **Single Input**: When recreating `UNanofabTools/app/templates/chem/remove.html`, test the `single input` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
3. **Large Input**: When recreating `UNanofabTools/app/templates/chem/remove.html`, test the `large input` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
4. **Duplicate Input**: When recreating `UNanofabTools/app/templates/chem/remove.html`, test the `duplicate input` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
5. **Malformed Input**: When recreating `UNanofabTools/app/templates/chem/remove.html`, test the `malformed input` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
6. **Missing File**: When recreating `UNanofabTools/app/templates/chem/remove.html`, test the `missing file` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
7. **Permission Denied**: When recreating `UNanofabTools/app/templates/chem/remove.html`, test the `permission denied` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system.
