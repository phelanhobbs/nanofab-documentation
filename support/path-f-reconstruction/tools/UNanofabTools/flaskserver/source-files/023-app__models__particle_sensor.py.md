## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.

## Line-By-Line Reconstruction Notes

### Line 1

```text
"""
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/app/models/particle_sensor.py`, line 1 is classified as `generic`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This line contributes to the file's behavior or documentation. Recreate it by preserving inputs, outputs, ordering, and side effects; edge cases are missing context, unexpected data, and differences between development and production. Neighbor context: previous kind is `none` and next kind is `generic`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 2

```text
Particle Sensor Data Model
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/app/models/particle_sensor.py`, line 2 is classified as `generic`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This line contributes to the file's behavior or documentation. Recreate it by preserving inputs, outputs, ordering, and side effects; edge cases are missing context, unexpected data, and differences between development and production. Neighbor context: previous kind is `generic` and next kind is `generic`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 3

```text
"""
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/app/models/particle_sensor.py`, line 3 is classified as `generic`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This line contributes to the file's behavior or documentation. Recreate it by preserving inputs, outputs, ordering, and side effects; edge cases are missing context, unexpected data, and differences between development and production. Neighbor context: previous kind is `generic` and next kind is `import`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 4

```text
from datetime import datetime
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/app/models/particle_sensor.py`, line 4 is classified as `import`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This dependency line names an external package, standard-library module, or local module. A rebuild must install or recreate that dependency before this file can run; edge cases are missing packages, version drift, import cycles, and local module name collisions. Neighbor context: previous kind is `generic` and next kind is `import`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 5

```text
from . import db
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/app/models/particle_sensor.py`, line 5 is classified as `import`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This dependency line names an external package, standard-library module, or local module. A rebuild must install or recreate that dependency before this file can run; edge cases are missing packages, version drift, import cycles, and local module name collisions. Neighbor context: previous kind is `import` and next kind is `blank`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 6

```text
<blank line>
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/app/models/particle_sensor.py`, line 6 is classified as `blank`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This blank line separates neighboring ideas. Keep an equivalent separation when recreating the file so imports, configuration, control flow, and output sections remain reviewable. Neighbor context: previous kind is `import` and next kind is `blank`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 7

```text

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/app/models/particle_sensor.py`, line 8 is classified as `class`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This class boundary groups state and behavior. Recreate the constructor expectations, instance attributes, inheritance, class-level constants, and public methods; edge cases include partially initialized objects, reused instances, and serialization or database mapping assumptions. Neighbor context: previous kind is `blank` and next kind is `generic`.

### Line 10

```text
    __tablename__ = 'particle_sensor_data'
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/app/models/particle_sensor.py`, line 10 is classified as `assignment`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This assignment establishes configuration, state, a constant, or an intermediate value. Preserve when it is evaluated, whether it is mutable, whether it can be overridden, and whether it is safe to expose; edge cases include defaults that are fine locally but unsafe in production. Neighbor context: previous kind is `generic` and next kind is `assignment`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
21. **Disk Pressure**: When recreating `UNanofabTools/app/models/particle_sensor.py`, test the `disk pressure` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
22. **Old Source Copy**: When recreating `UNanofabTools/app/models/particle_sensor.py`, test the `old source copy` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
23. **Production Versus Development Configuration**: When recreating `UNanofabTools/app/models/particle_sensor.py`, test the `production versus development configuration` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
24. **Redacted Secret Reconstruction**: When recreating `UNanofabTools/app/models/particle_sensor.py`, test the `redacted secret reconstruction` case explicitly. The expected result is not merely that the code avoids crashing; the expected result is that the user-visible response, log entry, database state, file output, and follow-up operational instruction remain consistent with the rest of the system. If the original behavior is unsafe, document the compatibility break and the reason before changing it.
