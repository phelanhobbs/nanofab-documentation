## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.

## Line-By-Line Reconstruction Notes

### Line 1

```text
"""
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/app/blueprints/tasks.py`, line 1 is classified as `generic`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This line contributes to the file's behavior or documentation. Recreate it by preserving inputs, outputs, ordering, and side effects; edge cases are missing context, unexpected data, and differences between development and production. Neighbor context: previous kind is `none` and next kind is `generic`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 2

```text

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/app/blueprints/tasks.py`, line 2 is classified as `generic`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This line contributes to the file's behavior or documentation. Recreate it by preserving inputs, outputs, ordering, and side effects; edge cases are missing context, unexpected data, and differences between development and production.

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/app/blueprints/tasks.py`, line 3 is classified as `generic`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This line contributes to the file's behavior or documentation. Recreate it by preserving inputs, outputs, ordering, and side effects; edge cases are missing context, unexpected data, and differences between development and production. Neighbor context: previous kind is `generic` and next kind is `import`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 4

```text
from flask import Blueprint, render_template, request, redirect, url_for, flash, jsonify, send_file
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/app/blueprints/tasks.py`, line 4 is classified as `import`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This dependency line names an external package, standard-library module, or local module. A rebuild must install or recreate that dependency before this file can run; edge cases are missing packages, version drift, import cycles, and local module name collisions. Neighbor context: previous kind is `generic` and next kind is `import`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/app/blueprints/tasks.py`, line 8 is classified as `blank`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This blank line separates neighboring ideas. Keep an equivalent separation when recreating the file so imports, configuration, control flow, and output sections remain reviewable. Neighbor context: previous kind is `import` and next kind is `assignment`.

A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This assignment establishes configuration, state, a constant, or an intermediate value. Preserve when it is evaluated, whether it is mutable, whether it can be overridden, and whether it is safe to expose; edge cases include defaults that are fine locally but unsafe in production.

```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/app/blueprints/tasks.py`, line 12 is classified as `route`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This route decorator is an HTTP contract. Preserve the URL rule, allowed methods, authentication posture, request payload shape, response type, redirects, template names, and side effects; edge cases include wrong method, missing form fields, unauthenticated callers, stale sessions, and malformed device payloads. Neighbor context: previous kind is `blank` and next kind is `generic`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/app/blueprints/tasks.py`, line 14 is classified as `function`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This function boundary is an interface. Preserve its name-level responsibility, parameters, return value, exceptions, side effects, and logging behavior; edge cases include None inputs, empty collections, filesystem absence, failed network calls, and repeated invocation. Neighbor context: previous kind is `generic` and next kind is `generic`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

A rebuild must install or recreate that dependency before this file can run; edge cases are missing packages, version drift, import cycles, and local module name collisions.
