## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.

# Chemical Inventory System

A comprehensive chemical inventory management system integrated into the UNanofab Tools Flask application.

## Features

- 🔍 **Search & Browse** - Search chemicals by name, vendor, location, barcode, owner, or system
- ➕ **Add Containers** - Add new chemical containers with auto-generated barcodes
- 📊 **Reports & Analytics** - View expiring chemicals, statistics by room/vendor/system/owner
- 📱 **Barcode Scanning** - Upload barcode scan files to track inventory cycles
- 🖨️ **Print View** - Print-friendly inventory listings
- 🔐 **Authentication** - Integrated with Flask-Login for secure access
- 🗄️ **PostgreSQL Backend** - Robust database with full ACID compliance

## Quick Start

### 1. Install PostgreSQL

```bash
# macOS
brew install postgresql@15
brew services start postgresql@15

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

### 2. Create Database

```bash
psql postgres
```

```sql
CREATE DATABASE cheminventory;
CREATE USER chemadmin WITH PASSWORD 'YourSecurePassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE cheminventory TO chemadmin;
\q
```

### 3. Configure (update `.env`)

```bash
CHEM_PGHOST=localhost
CHEM_PGPORT=5432
CHEM_POSTGRES_DB=cheminventory
CHEM_POSTGRES_USER=chemadmin
CHEM_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<redacted-secret-value>
```

### 4. Install Dependencies & Initialize

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python init_chem_db.py
```

### 5. Start Flask App

```bash
python run.py
```

### 6. Access

Navigate to: `http://localhost:5000/chem/inventory`

## Routes

| Route | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/chem/inventory` | Main inventory view with search |
| `/chem/inventory/print` | Print-friendly view |
| `/chem/add` | Add new containers |
| `/chem/report` | Reports and analytics |
| `/chem/upload-scans` | Upload barcode scans |

## Database Schema

### Tables

- **categories** - Chemical categories (e.g., "Chemicals", "Solvents")
- **vendors** - Vendor information (e.g., Fisher, Sigma-Aldrich)
- **rooms** - Storage locations with room numbers and descriptions
- **items** - Chemical definitions (material name, catalog #, physical state)
- **containers** - Individual bottles/containers with unique barcodes
- **inventory_cycles** - Barcode scanning sessions
- **scan_raw** - Raw barcode scans from uploaded files
- **container_scans** - Matched container scans

### Views

- **inventory_view** - Comprehensive view combining all data for display
- **v_all_containers** - Simplified container listing
- **v_cycle_report** - Inventory cycle statistics

### Sequences

- **seq_barcode** - Auto-incrementing barcode generator (starts at 100001)

## Usage Examples

### Adding a Chemical

1. Navigate to `/chem/add`
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Material Name**: Acetone (required)
   - **Vendor**: Fisher Scientific
   - **Size**: 500
   - **Unit**: mL
   - **Quantity**: 3 (creates 3 containers with unique barcodes)
   - **Location**: Room 02022N, Bay A
   - **Dates**: Entry, manufacture, expiration
3. Submit - barcodes are automatically assigned

### Searching

1. Go to `/chem/inventory`
2. Enter search term in the search box
3. Searches across:
   - Material name
   - Description
   - Vendor
   - Room number/name
   - Barcode
   - Container code
   - Owner
   - System

### Viewing Reports

1. Navigate to `/chem/report`
2. See summary cards:
   - Total containers
   - Unique materials
   - Expiring within 30 days
   - Expired items
3. Browse tabs:
   - **Expiring Soon** - Items expiring in next 30 days
   - **Expired** - Past expiration date
   - **NMR Expiring** - NMR certifications due
   - **By Room** - Container counts per room
   - **By Vendor** - Container counts per vendor
   - **By System** - Container counts per system
   - **By Owner** - Container counts per owner

### Uploading Barcode Scans

1. Create a text file with one barcode per line:
   ```
   100001
   100002
   100003
   ```
2. Navigate to `/chem/upload-scans`
3. Upload the file
4. System creates a cycle and matches barcodes
5. View results in reports

## API Integration

The system uses a service layer for easy integration:

```python
from app.services.chem_service import ChemInventoryService

service = ChemInventoryService()

# Search inventory
results = service.search_inventory(query="acetone", limit=100)

# Add containers
data = {
    'name': 'Acetone',
    'vendor_name': 'Fisher',
    'qty': 5,
    # ... other fields
}
count = service.add_containers(data)

# Get reports
reports = service.get_reports()

# Import scans
cycle_id = service.import_scans(codes=['100001', '100002'],
                                 filename='scan.txt',
                                 user='phelan')
```

## Security

- ✅ All routes protected with `@login_required`
- ✅ SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Environment-based configuration
- ✅ Password storage in environment variables

## Backup & Maintenance

### Database Backup

```bash
# Backup
pg_dump -U chemadmin cheminventory > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Restore
psql -U chemadmin cheminventory < backup_20241110.sql
```

### Update Schema

```bash
# Edit chem_schema.sql, then:
python init_chem_db.py
```

### Monitor Performance

```bash
# Check active connections
psql -U chemadmin -d cheminventory -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;"

# Check table sizes
psql -U chemadmin -d cheminventory -c "\dt+"
```

## Troubleshooting

See **CHEM_INVENTORY_SETUP.md** for detailed troubleshooting.

Common issues:

- **Connection refused**: PostgreSQL not running
- **Authentication failed**: Check password in `.env`
- **Tables not found**: Run `python init_chem_db.py`
- **Module not found**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
