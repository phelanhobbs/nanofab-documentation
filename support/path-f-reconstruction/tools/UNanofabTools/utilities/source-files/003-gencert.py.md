## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.
