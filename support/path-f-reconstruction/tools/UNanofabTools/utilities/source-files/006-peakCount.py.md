## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.

## Line-By-Line Reconstruction Notes

### Line 1

```text
import numpy as np
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/peakCount.py`, line 1 is classified as `import`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This dependency line names an external package, standard-library module, or local module. A rebuild must install or recreate that dependency before this file can run; edge cases are missing packages, version drift, import cycles, and local module name collisions. Neighbor context: previous kind is `none` and next kind is `import`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/peakCount.py`, line 212 is classified as `generic`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This line contributes to the file's behavior or documentation. Recreate it by preserving inputs, outputs, ordering, and side effects; edge cases are missing context, unexpected data, and differences between development and production. Neighbor context: previous kind is `assignment` and next kind is `generic`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

This branch decides between pathways. Recreate the condition and both the taken and not-taken behavior; edge cases include falsy values, missing keys, unexpected types, stale state, and a condition that was assumed impossible but occurs in production. Neighbor context: previous kind is `blank` and next kind is `generic`.
