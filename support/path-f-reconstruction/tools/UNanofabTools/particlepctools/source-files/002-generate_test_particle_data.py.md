## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.

## Line-By-Line Reconstruction Notes

### Line 1

```text
#!/usr/bin/env python3
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/generate_test_particle_data.py`, line 1 is classified as `comment`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This comment or prose line records intent, operator guidance, or historical context. Recreate the underlying behavior from code evidence, but preserve any operational warning because comments here often explain safety boundaries. Neighbor context: previous kind is `none` and next kind is `generic`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 2

```text

```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/generate_test_particle_data.py`, line 2 is classified as `generic`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This line contributes to the file's behavior or documentation. Recreate it by preserving inputs, outputs, ordering, and side effects; edge cases are missing context, unexpected data, and differences between development and production. Neighbor context: previous kind is `comment` and next kind is `generic`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 3

Recreate it by preserving inputs, outputs, ordering, and side effects; edge cases are missing context, unexpected data, and differences between development and production.

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/generate_test_particle_data.py`, line 7 is classified as `blank`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This blank line separates neighboring ideas. Keep an equivalent separation when recreating the file so imports, configuration, control flow, and output sections remain reviewable. Neighbor context: previous kind is `generic` and next kind is `import`.

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/generate_test_particle_data.py`, line 8 is classified as `import`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This dependency line names an external package, standard-library module, or local module. A rebuild must install or recreate that dependency before this file can run; edge cases are missing packages, version drift, import cycles, and local module name collisions. Neighbor context: previous kind is `blank` and next kind is `import`.

Neighbor context: previous kind is `assignment` and next kind is `comment`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 145

```text
        # Build the data structure
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/generate_test_particle_data.py`, line 145 is classified as `comment`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This comment or prose line records intent, operator guidance, or historical context. Recreate the underlying behavior from code evidence, but preserve any operational warning because comments here often explain safety boundaries. Neighbor context: previous kind is `blank` and next kind is `assignment`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 146

```text
        data = {
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/generate_test_particle_data.py`, line 146 is classified as `assignment`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This assignment establishes configuration, state, a constant, or an intermediate value. Preserve when it is evaluated, whether it is mutable, whether it can be overridden, and whether it is safe to expose; edge cases include defaults that are fine locally but unsafe in production. Neighbor context: previous kind is `comment` and next kind is `generic`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This branch decides between pathways. Recreate the condition and both the taken and not-taken behavior; edge cases include falsy values, missing keys, unexpected types, stale state, and a condition that was assumed impossible but occurs in production. Neighbor context: previous kind is `assignment` and next kind is `assignment`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 279

```text
        timestamp = int(datetime.now().timestamp())
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/generate_test_particle_data.py`, line 279 is classified as `assignment`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This assignment establishes configuration, state, a constant, or an intermediate value. Preserve when it is evaluated, whether it is mutable, whether it can be overridden, and whether it is safe to expose; edge cases include defaults that are fine locally but unsafe in production. Neighbor context: previous kind is `branch` and next kind is `loop`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 280

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/generate_test_particle_data.py`, line 280 is classified as `loop`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This loop repeats work over files, rows, devices, users, months, or sensor samples. Preserve ordering, termination, empty-input handling, duplicate handling, and partial-failure behavior; edge cases are zero items, one item, many items, and one bad item among many good ones. Neighbor context: previous kind is `assignment` and next kind is `assignment`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.
