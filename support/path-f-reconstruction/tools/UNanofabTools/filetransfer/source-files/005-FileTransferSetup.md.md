## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.

Version: 0.0.3


Here are the steps to setup a new instance of the file tranfer powershell script on a new machine used in the Nanofab. Additionally, instructions to setup a new server are below.

1) Ensure that all the required programs are installed on the machine being used in the nanofab
    The relevant programs are Windows PowerShell (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) and PuTTY (https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).
    Please note down where PuTTY is installed.
    Please note what version of PuTTY is being installed, as PuTTY only supports Windows XP and Vista up until 0.74. Otherwise,
    use the most recent version for the reasons of security.

2) Ensure that you are on the correct network
    Currently, due to security concerns, the server only accepts ssh commands from machines registered to the CoE network. Even things like UConnect do not work due to the CoE IT's security policy.
    This can be accomplished by opening Powershell or command prompt and using the "ipconfig" command, the connected network will be listed under "Connection-specific DNS suffix". Alternatively, if you look up your IP, it should begin with 155.98.11.xx or 155.98.92.xx

3) Transfer the FileTransferTemplate.ps1 file onto the machine and rename it


4) Step 4 will depend on if you are running on a more modern version of windows (eg windows 11) you should follow method A
        but on older operating systems such as windows XP or Windows Vista, please follow method B

    _A: Modern Windows
    Open PowerShell and run the command "ssh-keygen -t rsa".
        You will be prompted "Enter file in which to save the key...", just call it "id_rsa". You will then be prompted for a passphrase, just hit enter twice to have no passphrase. Trust me, it's easier this way.
        Then please note where id_rsa is saved.
        Go to step 4

    _B: Older Windows
    Open PuTTYGen (included with your install of puTTY) and hit "Generate", using the mouse to generate randomness
        Note down the "Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys file" and the private key which can be saved
        when saving the private key, call it id_rsa.ppk and do not set a password (just skip through it)
        Go to step 8

5) In Powershell, use the command "type" followed by the location of the id_rsa.pub key (example syntax
    "type C:\Users\machine\id_rsa.pub) and hit enter.
    This will display a set of text starting with "ssh-rsa" followed by a bunch of letters. Copy or note the entire response (including ssh-rsa)

6) Open PuTTYgen click "load" and navigate to the id_rsa.pub file. You may need to change the filetype from
    ".ppk" to "All Files *" and hit "Save the private key". Place it along side the id_rsa.

7) Right Click on your .ppk file and open "Properties" and navigate to the "security" tab and ensure that
    only the name of the machine has access. If any others are listed hit "advanced" and remove them

8) Now, remote into the server using Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) and open Powershell
    Run the command "notepad++ ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

9) This will open a file. On a new line, add your entire key and save. DO NOT MESS WITH THE OTHER KEYS!

10) Decide where you'd like your folder to save your files. Please create a folder inside the LOGFILES
    folder and use that. Name it something easy to remember like MACHINEDATA

11) Right click the renamed .ps1 file and click edit, which will open the PowerShell ISA

12) There are going to be a handful of variables that are surrounded by ######## on the top and bottom
    These must be updated with the relevant file locations
    Importantly, there are four filepaths that need to be changed
        $watcherPath - This is the location of where logfiles from the machine are stored
        $pscpPath - This is the location of where PuTTY is saved
        $privateKeyPath - This is the location of your private key (from step 6)
        $remotePath - this is where the server will store the logfiles on the VM

13) Run the service to verify that it is working and able to transfer files from the machine to the VM
    If not, go back and determine what might be the issue
    If it does, note the file path of the .ps1 file

14) On the machine being used in the lab, hit Windows+R and write in taskschd.msc and hit enter

15) In the Task Scheduler, click on Create Task on right hand pane.

16) Give the task a name and description and select both "Run whether user is logged on or not" and "Run with highest privileges"

17) In the "Triggers" tab, click new and set the trigger to "At startup" and hit OK

18) In the actions tab, click New and set action to "Start a program"

19) In the Program/Script Field, find powershell.exe and add "-File "C:\path\to\script\TransferScript.ps1" in the arguements (replacing the file name appropriately)
        Note that by default, Powershell is located at "C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe

20) In the settings tab, select "Allow task to be run on demand" and "restart the task if it fails"

21) Click Ok to save the task, entering the password if prompted

STARTING THE SCRIPT
1) Recall that the file transfer script is located on the decice and recall where it is saved
        This is why I like to place my scripts in C:/Users/[name]/Desktop/script, makes it easy to rememeber

2) Navigate to the folder that the script is located

3) If running on a more modern version of Windows such as Windows 11,
        right click the PS1 powershell script and click "Run with Powershell"
    If running on an old version of Windows like Windows XP,
        run the script by double clicking the batch file

4) Ensure that the script runs properly both right at runtime and the next morning

5) Bug test or make alterations as needed
