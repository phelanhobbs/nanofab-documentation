## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.

# 🚀 Flask Setup Guide - Step by Step

## ✅ What's Already Done

I've completed the following for you:
- ✅ Created all Flask application files (blueprints, services, models)
- ✅ Updated all HTML templates to use Flask/Jinja2 syntax
- ✅ Copied JavaScript files to `app/static/js/`
- ✅ Created `.env` file from template
- ✅ Set up proper directory structure

## 📋 Setup Steps (Follow These)

### Step 1: Install Python Dependencies

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd /Users/phe/code/work/UNanofabTools

# Install all required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Expected output:** You'll see packages being installed (Flask, Flask-Login, SQLAlchemy, etc.)

---

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Edit the `.env` file with your settings:

```bash
# Open the .env file in your editor
nano .env
# or
code .env
# or
open -e .env
```

**Required changes:**

1. **SECRET_KEY** - Generate a random key:
   ```bash
   python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))'
   ```
   Copy the output and paste it in `.env`

2. **DEBUG_MODE** - Set to `True` for testing, `False` for production
   ```
   DEBUG_MODE=True
   ```

3. **HOST** - For development, use localhost:
   ```
   HOST=localhost
   ```

4. **SSL Certificate Paths** - Point to your SSL certificates:
   ```
   SSL_CERT_PATH=/path/to/your/cert.pem
   SSL_KEY_PATH=/path/to/your/key.pem
   ```

5. **Duo Security** - Add your Duo credentials:
   ```
   DUO_IKEY=your-duo-integration-key
   DUO_SKEY=your-duo-secret-key
   DUO_HOST=your-duo-api-host
   ```

**Save the file** when done (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter in nano)

---

### Step 3: Verify Directory Structure

Check that everything is in place:

```bash
# Check application structure
ls -la app/
ls -la app/blueprints/
ls -la app/services/
ls -la app/templates/
ls -la app/static/js/

# Check configuration
ls -la config/
cat .env | grep -v "^#"
```

You should see:
- ✅ `app/` with `__init__.py`, `blueprints/`, `services/`, `models/`, `templates/`, `static/`
- ✅ `config/config.py`
- ✅ `.env` file with your configuration
- ✅ `run.py` entry point

---

### Step 4: Initialize the Database

The Flask app will automatically create database tables on first run, but let's verify your existing databases are accessible:

```bash
# Check if your databases exist
ls -la *.db
```

You should see:
- `signininfo.db` - User accounts
- `sessioninfo.db` - Active sessions (will be recreated)
- `tasks.db` - Task management

**Good news:** The new Flask models are 100% compatible with your existing databases!

---

### Step 5: Run the Application

For development/testing:

```bash
# Set environment to development
export FLASK_ENV=development

# Run the Flask application
python run.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
 * Serving Flask app 'app'
 * Debug mode: on
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in production.
 * Running on https://localhost:443
```

---

### Step 6: Test the Application

Open your browser and navigate to:
- `https://localhost:443/` - Home page
- `https://localhost:443/login` - Login page
- `https://localhost:443/machines` - Machines page

**Note:** Your browser may show a security warning about the SSL certificate in development mode. This is normal - click "Advanced" and "Proceed" to continue.

---

### Step 7: Test Key Features

1. **Login**
   - Navigate to `/login`
   - Enter your username and password
   - You should be redirected to `/tasks` after successful login

2. **View Machines**
   - Navigate to `/machines`
   - Click on any machine (e.g., ALD)
   - Verify data displays correctly

3. **Task Management**
   - Navigate to `/tasks`
   - Try creating a task if you have permissions
   - Try claiming a task

4. **Admin Panel** (if you're an admin)
   - Navigate to `/adminpanel`
   - Verify user list displays

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Import errors or "Module not found"

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Problem: "Template not found"

**Solution:** Make sure HTML files are in `app/templates/`:
```bash
ls app/templates/
```

### Problem: Static files (JavaScript) not loading

**Solution:** Verify JavaScript files are in `app/static/js/`:
```bash
ls app/static/js/
```

### Problem: Database errors

**Solution:** The Flask app uses SQLAlchemy but is compatible with your existing SQLite databases. If you encounter issues:
```bash
# Backup your databases first
cp signininfo.db signininfo.db.backup
cp tasks.db tasks.db.backup

# Then restart the application - it will recreate sessioninfo.db
python run.py
```

### Problem: SSL certificate errors

**Solution for development:** Set `DEBUG_MODE=True` in `.env` and the app will run with relaxed SSL requirements.

**Solution for production:** Make sure your SSL certificate paths are correct:
```bash
# Check if certificates exist
ls -la /path/to/cert.pem
ls -la /path/to/key.pem
```

### Problem: Port 443 already in use

**Solution:** Change the port in `.env`:
```
PORT=8443
```
Then access the site at `https://localhost:8443`

### Problem: Duo 2FA not working

**Solution for testing:** Set `DEBUG_MODE=True` in `.env` to skip 2FA during development.

**Solution for production:** Verify your Duo credentials in `.env`:
```bash
grep DUO .env
```

---

## 🎯 Next Steps After Setup

Once the application is running successfully:

1. **Test All Features**
   - Login/logout
   - Task management
   - Machine data viewing
   - Admin panel (if admin)
   - Raspberry Pi data collection endpoints

2. **Deploy to Production**
   - Update `.env` with production settings
   - Set `DEBUG_MODE=False`
   - Set `FLASK_ENV=production`
   - Use a production WSGI server (see below)

3. **Use a Production Server**
   ```bash
   # Install Gunicorn
   pip install gunicorn

   # Run with Gunicorn
   gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:443 \
     --certfile=/path/to/cert.pem \
     --keyfile=/path/to/key.pem \
     run:app
   ```

---

## 📚 Quick Command Reference

```bash
# Development mode
export FLASK_ENV=development
python run.py

# Production mode
export FLASK_ENV=production
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:443 --certfile=cert.pem --keyfile=key.pem run:app

# Check logs
tail -f logs/untools.log  # (in production)

# Install new packages
pip install package-name
pip freeze > requirements.txt  # Update requirements

# Database backup
cp *.db backups/
```

<blank line>
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/SETUP_GUIDE.md`, line 336 is classified as `blank`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This blank line separates neighboring ideas. Keep an equivalent separation when recreating the file so imports, configuration, control flow, and output sections remain reviewable. Neighbor context: previous kind is `prose` and next kind is `comment`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

### Line 337

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/SETUP_GUIDE.md`, line 337 is classified as `comment`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This comment or prose line records intent, operator guidance, or historical context. Recreate the underlying behavior from code evidence, but preserve any operational warning because comments here often explain safety boundaries.
