## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.

## Database Structure

### PostgreSQL Tables
- `categories` - Chemical categories
- `vendors` - Vendor information
- `rooms` - Storage locations
- `items` - Chemical definitions (unique materials)
- `containers` - Individual bottles with barcodes
- `inventory_cycles` - Scanning sessions
- `scan_raw` - Raw barcode scans
- `container_scans` - Matched scans

### Views
- `inventory_view` - Main view for displaying inventory
- `v_all_containers` - Simplified container view
- `v_cycle_report` - Cycle statistics

### Sequences
- `seq_barcode` - Auto-incrementing barcode (starts at 100001)

## Setup Required

You need to complete these steps to use the chemical inventory:

### 1. Install PostgreSQL
```bash
# macOS
brew install postgresql@15
brew services start postgresql@15

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

### 2. Create Database
```bash
psql postgres
CREATE DATABASE cheminventory;
CREATE USER chemadmin WITH PASSWORD 'YourPassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE cheminventory TO chemadmin;
\q
```

### 3. Configure Environment
Add to `.env`:
```bash
CHEM_PGHOST=localhost
CHEM_PGPORT=5432
CHEM_POSTGRES_DB=cheminventory
CHEM_POSTGRES_USER=chemadmin
CHEM_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<redacted-secret-value>
```

### 4. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Initialize Database
```bash
python init_chem_db.py
```

### 6. Start Flask App
```bash
python run.py
```

### 7. Access
Navigate to: `https://yourserver/chem/inventory`

## Routes Available

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/chem/` or `/chem/inventory` | Main inventory view with search |
| `/chem/inventory/print` | Print-friendly inventory list |
| `/chem/add` | Add new chemical containers |
| `/chem/report` | Reports and analytics |
| `/chem/upload-scans` | Upload barcode scan files |

## Integration Points

### With Main Flask App
- Uses same Flask app instance
- Shares authentication (Flask-Login)
- Registered as blueprint
- Links in navigation to main app and tasks

### With Existing Chem App
- Database schema compatible
- Can use existing PostgreSQL database
- All functionality preserved
- Enhanced with authentication and navigation

### Configuration
- Uses environment variables from `.env`
- Fallback to generic POSTGRES_* variables
- Configurable host, port, database, credentials

```

## Technical Details

### Database Connection
- Uses SQLAlchemy's `create_engine()` for PostgreSQL
- Connection pooling enabled
- Transactions managed with `engine.begin()`

### Barcode Generation
- PostgreSQL sequence `seq_barcode`
- Starts at 100001
- Auto-increments
- Guaranteed unique

### Search Implementation
- Case-insensitive LIKE queries
- Searches multiple fields
- Configurable result limit (default 500)
- Ordered by material name, room, barcode

### Report Queries
- Uses PostgreSQL window functions
- Date filtering with INTERVAL
- Grouping and aggregation
- Optimized with indexes

## Security Considerations

✅ **Authentication**
- All routes protected with `@login_required`
- Uses existing Flask-Login setup

✅ **Input Validation**
- Form data sanitized (strip whitespace)
- Quantity limited (1-500)
- File upload restricted to .txt

✅ **SQL Injection Prevention**
- All queries use parameterized statements
- SQLAlchemy text() with bound parameters

✅ **Database Credentials**
- Stored in environment variables
- Not committed to git
- Configurable per environment

## Testing Checklist

Once setup is complete, test these:

- [ ] Login to Flask app
- [ ] Navigate to `/chem/inventory`
- [ ] Search for chemicals
- [ ] Add a new container
- [ ] Verify barcode generation
- [ ] View reports
- [ ] Check expiring chemicals
- [ ] Upload a scan file (create test.txt with barcodes)
- [ ] Print inventory view
- [ ] Logout and verify protection

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Setup** - Follow CHEM_INVENTORY_SETUP.md
2. **Import Data** - If you have existing data, migrate it
3. **Configure Backups** - Set up PostgreSQL backups
4. **Train Users** - Show team how to use the system
5. **Customize** - Adjust fields/reports for your needs
6. **Integrate Scanners** - Connect barcode scanners
7. **Set Alerts** - Configure notifications for expiring chemicals

## Maintenance

### Database Backups
```bash
# Backup
pg_dump -U chemadmin cheminventory > backup.sql

# Restore
psql -U chemadmin cheminventory < backup.sql
```

### Updating Schema
Edit `chem_schema.sql` and re-run:
```bash
python init_chem_db.py
```

### Monitoring
Check PostgreSQL logs:
```bash
tail -f /usr/local/var/log/postgresql@15.log  # macOS
sudo tail -f /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-15-main.log  # Ubuntu
```

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check `CHEM_INVENTORY_SETUP.md` for troubleshooting
2. Review `FLASK_MIGRATION.md` for detailed documentation
3. Verify PostgreSQL is running: `psql --version`
4. Check logs in terminal when running Flask app
5. Test database connection: `psql -U chemadmin -d cheminventory`

## Success!

The chemical inventory system is now fully integrated into your Flask server. Once you complete the setup steps, you'll have a professional chemical tracking system with search, reports, barcode scanning, and full integration with your existing authentication and navigation.
