## Reconstruction Purpose

This section is written so a maintainer can recreate the file's behavior without opening the source tree. The sanitized code excerpt preserves structure and names while removing secret-looking literal values. The line-by-line notes explain the operational reason for each line, the behavior that must survive a rewrite, and the edge cases to test.

## Files Modified

1. **app/__init__.py** - Added chem blueprint registration and date formatter
2. **config/config.py** - Added PostgreSQL configuration for chemical inventory
3. **requirements.txt** - Added psycopg2-binary and xlsxwriter

## Key Features Integrated

✅ **Inventory Management**
- Search across all fields (name, vendor, room, barcode, etc.)
- View all containers with full details
- Print-friendly view for physical inventory

✅ **Add Containers**
- Add new chemical containers with auto-generated barcodes
- Support for bulk creation (quantity field)
- Comprehensive fields: location, dates, compliance, ownership

✅ **Reports & Analytics**
- Summary statistics (total containers, unique materials, expiring, expired)
- Expiring chemicals (next 30 days)
- Expired chemicals listing
- NMR expiration tracking
- Breakdown by room, vendor, system, owner

✅ **Barcode Scanning**
- Upload text files with scanned barcodes
- Creates inventory cycles
- Matches barcodes to containers
- Tracks found/missing items

✅ **Authentication**
- Integrated with Flask-Login
- All routes protected by @login_required
- Uses existing user authentication

✅ **Navigation**
- Dedicated chemical inventory navigation bar
- Links back to main app
- Links to tasks system
- User/logout in nav

## Database Structure

### PostgreSQL Tables
- `categories` - Chemical categories
- `vendors` - Vendor information
- `rooms` - Storage locations
- `items` - Chemical definitions (unique materials)
- `containers` - Individual bottles with barcodes
- `inventory_cycles` - Scanning sessions
- `scan_raw` - Raw barcode scans
- `container_scans` - Matched scans

### Views
- `inventory_view` - Main view for displaying inventory
- `v_all_containers` - Simplified container view
- `v_cycle_report` - Cycle statistics

### Sequences
- `seq_barcode` - Auto-incrementing barcode (starts at 100001)

## Setup Required

You need to complete these steps to use the chemical inventory:

### 1. Install PostgreSQL
```bash
# macOS
brew install postgresql@15
brew services start postgresql@15

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

### 2. Create Database
```bash
psql postgres
CREATE DATABASE cheminventory;
CREATE USER chemadmin WITH PASSWORD 'YourPassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE cheminventory TO chemadmin;
\q
```

### 3. Configure Environment
Add to `.env`:
```bash
CHEM_PGHOST=localhost
CHEM_PGPORT=5432
CHEM_POSTGRES_DB=cheminventory
CHEM_POSTGRES_USER=chemadmin
CHEM_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<redacted-secret-value>
```

### 4. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Initialize Database
```bash
python init_chem_db.py
```

### 6. Start Flask App
```bash
python run.py
```

### 7. Access
Navigate to: `https://yourserver/chem/inventory`

## Routes Available

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/chem/` or `/chem/inventory` | Main inventory view with search |
| `/chem/inventory/print` | Print-friendly inventory list |
| `/chem/add` | Add new chemical containers |
| `/chem/report` | Reports and analytics |
| `/chem/upload-scans` | Upload barcode scan files |

## Integration Points

### With Main Flask App
- Uses same Flask app instance
- Shares authentication (Flask-Login)
- Registered as blueprint
- Links in navigation to main app and tasks

### With Existing Chem App
- Database schema compatible
- Can use existing PostgreSQL database
- All functionality preserved
- Enhanced with authentication and navigation

### Configuration
- Uses environment variables from `.env`
- Fallback to generic POSTGRES_* variables
- Configurable host, port, database, credentials

```

## Technical Details

### Database Connection
- Uses SQLAlchemy's `create_engine()` for PostgreSQL
- Connection pooling enabled
- Transactions managed with `engine.begin()`

### Barcode Generation
- PostgreSQL sequence `seq_barcode`
- Starts at 100001
- Auto-increments
- Guaranteed unique

### Search Implementation
- Case-insensitive LIKE queries
- Searches multiple fields
- Configurable result limit (default 500)
- Ordered by material name, room, barcode

### Report Queries
- Uses PostgreSQL window functions
- Date filtering with INTERVAL
- Grouping and aggregation
- Optimized with indexes

## Security Considerations

✅ **Authentication**
- All routes protected with `@login_required`
- Uses existing Flask-Login setup

✅ **Input Validation**
- Form data sanitized (strip whitespace)
- Quantity limited (1-500)
- File upload restricted to .txt

✅ **SQL Injection Prevention**
- All queries use parameterized statements
- SQLAlchemy text() with bound parameters

✅ **Database Credentials**
- Stored in environment variables
- Not committed to git
- Configurable per environment

## Testing Checklist

Once setup is complete, test these:

- [ ] Login to Flask app
- [ ] Navigate to `/chem/inventory`
- [ ] Search for chemicals
- [ ] Add a new container
- [ ] Verify barcode generation
- [ ] View reports
- [ ] Check expiring chemicals
- [ ] Upload a scan file (create test.txt with barcodes)
- [ ] Print inventory view
- [ ] Logout and verify protection

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Setup** - Follow CHEM_INVENTORY_SETUP.md
2. **Import Data** - If you have existing data, migrate it
3. **Configure Backups** - Set up PostgreSQL backups
4. **Train Users** - Show team how to use the system
5. **Customize** - Adjust fields/reports for your needs
6. **Integrate Scanners** - Connect barcode scanners
7. **Set Alerts** - Configure notifications for expiring chemicals

## Maintenance

### Database Backups
```bash
# Backup
pg_dump -U chemadmin cheminventory > backup.sql

# Restore
psql -U chemadmin cheminventory < backup.sql
```

### Updating Schema
Edit `chem_schema.sql` and re-run:
```bash
python init_chem_db.py
```

### Monitoring
Check PostgreSQL logs:
```bash
tail -f /usr/local/var/log/postgresql@15.log  # macOS
sudo tail -f /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-15-main.log  # Ubuntu
```

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check `CHEM_INVENTORY_SETUP.md` for troubleshooting
2. Review `FLASK_MIGRATION.md` for detailed documentation
3. Verify PostgreSQL is running: `psql --version`
4. Check logs in terminal when running Flask app
5. Test database connection: `psql -U chemadmin -d cheminventory`

## Success!

The chemical inventory system is now fully integrated into your Flask server. Once you complete the setup steps, you'll have a professional chemical tracking system with search, reports, barcode scanning, and full integration with your existing authentication and navigation.

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md`, line 325 is classified as `prose`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This documentation line is part of the original repo's operator or developer guidance. Preserve the claim only if it still matches source and live state; edge cases include stale paths, old deployment assumptions, and instructions that expose secrets. Neighbor context: previous kind is `prose` and next kind is `prose`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md`, line 327 is classified as `blank`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This blank line separates neighboring ideas. Keep an equivalent separation when recreating the file so imports, configuration, control flow, and output sections remain reviewable. Neighbor context: previous kind is `prose` and next kind is `comment`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.

## Success!
```

Reconstruction rule: in `UNanofabTools/INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md`, line 328 is classified as `comment`. A compatible reimplementation must preserve the same observable contract even if the exact spelling changes. This comment or prose line records intent, operator guidance, or historical context. Recreate the underlying behavior from code evidence, but preserve any operational warning because comments here often explain safety boundaries. Neighbor context: previous kind is `blank` and next kind is `blank`. When rebuilding, check this line together with its neighbors rather than in isolation, because adjacent lines often provide setup, validation, or cleanup.
